## Project Title

## Description

This connect four game will feature a welcome screen (first HTML file) that describes the game/rules, which will then direct to a new page where the game is played. There will be a prompt somewhere on the screen that tells the player whether it is their turn or the computer's turn. Player and computer alternate moves through AI random moves until someone gets 4 in a row. When there is a winner, a winner alert will appear on the screen and there will be an option to replay the game. There will be a tracker that shows how many games have been one (will probably make it 2/3 to win)
