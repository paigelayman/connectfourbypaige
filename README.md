# Project Title

Four to Score

## Description

This connect four game will feature a welcome screen (first HTML file) that describes the game/rules, which will then direct to a new page where the game is played. There will be a prompt somewhere on the screen that tells the player whether it is their turn or the computer's turn. Player and computer alternate moves through AI random moves until someone gets 4 in a row. When there is a winner, a winner alert will appear on the screen and there will be an option to replay the game. There will be a tracker that shows how many games have been won (will probably make it win 2/3 to win and draws do not count).

## How to Get Started

Will first create basics of game with HTML pages, followed by CSS styling with flexbox to get the appearance of the game done. Then will start on JavaScript and console.log as I go to test each function before moving onto the next.
