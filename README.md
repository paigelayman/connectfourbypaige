### Project Title

Four to Score

### Description

This connect four game features a welcome screen that describes the game and rules, which then directs to a new page where the game is played. Player 1 and Player 2 alternate moves until someone gets 4 in a row. Each time a round is won, the winning player gains a point on the scoreboard. The first player to win three rounds wins the game, at which time a message displays announcing the winner.

### How to Get Started

Will first create basics of game with HTML pages, followed by CSS styling with flexbox to get the appearance of the game done. Then will start on JavaScript and console.log as I go to test each function before moving onto the next.
