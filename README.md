### Description

This connect four game features a welcome screen that describes the game and rules, which then directs to a new page where the game is played. Player 1 and Player 2 alternate moves until someone gets 4 in a row. Each time a round is won, the winning player gains a point on the scoreboard. There will then be a message announcing the winner and an option to play again.
